## Experimental Data Processing Lab №1 (English)

[Read this in Russian](README_ru.md)

## Description
This lab implements key methods for processing experimental data based on the normal distribution. Mathematical and statistical techniques are used to analyze random variables, calculate their characteristics, and plot graphs and distributions.

## Project Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TRV37/lab_1_PED.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd lab_1_PED
   ```

3. Create and activate a virtual environment (`venv`):

   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On Linux/MacOS:
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Project

1. Ensure that the virtual environment is activated.
2. Run the main project file:
   ```bash
   python Main.py
   ```

## Files

- `Main.py` — the main file containing data processing and graph plotting code.
- `requirements.txt` — a list of dependencies required for the project.
- `.gitignore` — a file to exclude unnecessary files from the repository, including `venv`.

## Libraries Used

The project uses the following key libraries:
- `numpy`
- `scipy`
- `matplotlib`
- `pandas`

### Note
Make sure to activate the virtual environment before running the project.
